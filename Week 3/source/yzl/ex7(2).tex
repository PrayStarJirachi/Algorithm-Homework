Because $T$ and $T'$ are two minimum spanning trees of $G$, according to Lemma 3, $T_{c}$ and $T'_{c}$ and $G_{c}$ have exactly the same components. Consider the number of components equals to $V - m_c(T)$, which $V$ is the total number of vertexs in $G$. if $m_c(T') \neq m_c(T)$, the number of components is not equal too, which is a contradictory. so $m_c(T')$ must equal to $m_c(T)$.
