		\item Balanced in learning from each each other.\pause
		\item Balanced in the problem-solving processes.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item There are two algorithms, both of which have different features, such as one can
		answer queries very quickly and the other cam handle modification swiftly.\pause
		\item There is an algorithm to solve the problems, but is quite complicated. Actually this algorithm
		is not the best choice in practice. The idea of balanced programming might be used to produced a suitable algorithm.
