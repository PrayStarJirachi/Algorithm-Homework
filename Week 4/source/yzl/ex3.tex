In $H_{n}[L_i \bigcup L_{i+1}]$, the degree of every vertex in $L_i$ is $n - i$ (transforming a zero in Hamming code to  one), and the degree of every vertex in $L_{i+1}$ is $i + 1$ (transforming an one in Hamming code to zero).\par

Using the conclusion what we have proved in Exercise 2, there exists a matching of size equals to $min(\binom{n}{i}, \binom{n}{i+1})$. when $i < n / 2$, the size equals to $\binom{n}{i}$.
