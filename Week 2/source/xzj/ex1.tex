\begin{itemize}
	\item First, we divide the elements of $A$ into $n/2$ pairs.
	\item Second, we make a comparison in each pair. Put the bigger one into array $B$, and put the smaller one into array $C$ 
	(If the two elements are equal, put one of them into $B$, and the other into $C$).

	It is obvious that the maximum is in $B$, and the minimum is in $C$.
	
	In this step, we get two arrays of size $n/2 - 1$ by $n/2$ comparisons.	
	\item Third, find the maximum in $B$ ($n/2 - 1$ comparisons) and the mimimum in $C$ ($n/2$ comparisons).
	
	these two elements are the maximum and minimum in $A$.
\end{itemize}

In all, the total number of comparisons is $N = n/2 + n / 2 - 1 + n / 2 - 1 = \frac{3}{2}n - 2$
