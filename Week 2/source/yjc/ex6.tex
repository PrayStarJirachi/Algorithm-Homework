The main difference between QUICKSELECT and QUICKSORT is that the QUICKSELECT only deal with one of the sequences parted by the pivot while the QUICKSORT process both.

Here is an figure about an example of choosing the $7$-th element in the sequence $[4, 2, 5, 6, 8, 1, 7, 3]$(The nodes colored blue are considered to be visited and
the node colored gray is the root).

	[inner sep=1mm,
	unvisited/.style={circle,draw=black,thick,dashed},

	\node (4) at (0, 0) [roots] {4};
	\node (2) at (-2.0, -3.0) [unvisited] {Unvisited Part};
	\node (5) at (1.3, -1.3) [visit] {5};
	\node (6) at (2.6, -2.6) [visit] {6};
	\node (8) at (3.9, -3.9) [visit] {8};
	\node (7) at (2.6, -5.2) [visit] {7};
