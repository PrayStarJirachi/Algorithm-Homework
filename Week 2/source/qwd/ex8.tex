        Since $A$ is a permutaion of size n, the answer for $QUICKSELECT(\pi=\{A,k\})$ is $k$. Similar like quicksort tree, quickselect tree is a quicksort tree without the nodes which haven't node $k$ in its subtree.\par
        So, elements $i$($i$ is pivot) and $j$($j\neq i$) will have a comparasion if and only if in quicksort tree, $i$ is a common ancestor of $k$ and $j$.\par
        Thus, the total number of comparasions is $$C(\pi) = \sum_{i\neq j}B_{i,j,k}$$
