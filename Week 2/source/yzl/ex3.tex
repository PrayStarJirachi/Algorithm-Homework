Consider the maximum is based on the \textbf{larger than}, a relation between two numbers. as you can see, this relation is transitive, and every comparison of two numbers can build a relationship. To make a number \textbf{maximum}, you need to build a directed tree-like structure which its root is the maximum number. In order to build such a structure, you need at least $n- 1$ edges. thus, you need to compare at least $n-1$ time to construct $n-1$ relations.
